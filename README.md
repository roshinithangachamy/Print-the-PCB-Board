## Proteus simulation

## AIM:
To design a circuit then simulate it and measure the voltage.
## EQUIPMENT REQUIRED:
●	Battery
●	LED
●	Switch
● DC voltmeter

## PROCEDURE:
1). Open Proteus ISIS.
2).Create a new project.
3). Add components using the "P" button.
4).Place components on the workspace and Wire the circuit.
5).Set component values/properties
6). Set component values/properties and Add virtual instruments
7). Click "Play" to simulate Debug and re-simulate if needed

## EXPECTED OUTPUT:
### LED off
